Didn't bother to write a file, solution done with a python REPL:

part 1: use the median

data.sort()
median = data[len(data) / 2]
sum([abs(x - median) for x in data])

part 2: use the mean & check which value is the lowest

mean = sum(data) / len(data)
sum([ abs(x - mean) * (abs(x - mean) + 1) / 2 for x in data])
